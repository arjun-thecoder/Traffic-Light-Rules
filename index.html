        <h1>STOP AT RED</h1>
        <p>A red signal means that all traffic must stop before the stop line or pedestrian crosswalk, and wait for the green signal before proceeding. Turning on red may not be permitted unless a separate signal allows for it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>GO ON GREEN</h1>
        <p>The green light allows traffic to proceed in the direction denoted by the signal.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>SLOW DOWN AT YELLOW</h1>
        <p>A yellow light signifies that the signal is about to turn red. If it is safe to do so, vehicles should come to a stop when the yellow light appears.</p>
